SERVERLESS WEB APPLICATION USING AWS

Project Description:
This project is a serverless web application developed using AWS cloud services.
It demonstrates how to build a scalable backend without managing servers.

The application processes user requests through APIs, executes backend logic
using AWS Lambda, and stores data in DynamoDB.

A detailed explanation of the project flow, architecture, and outputs is
provided in the attached PPT and screenshots.


Problem Statement:
Traditional server-based applications require server maintenance, manual
scaling, and higher operational costs. This project solves these challenges
by implementing a fully serverless architecture.


Solution Overview:
The application uses the following serverless architecture:
User → AWS Amplify → API Gateway → AWS Lambda → DynamoDB


Technologies Used:
- AWS Lambda
- Amazon API Gateway
- Amazon DynamoDB
- AWS Amplify
- GitHub


Application Flow:
1. User interacts with the frontend hosted on AWS Amplify
2. Frontend sends an HTTP request to API Gateway
3. API Gateway triggers the AWS Lambda function
4. Lambda processes the request and stores data in DynamoDB
5. Response is sent back to the frontend


Features:
- Fully serverless architecture
- Automatic scaling
- Low cost and high availability
- Secure data storage
- Easy frontend deployment
  

Future Enhancements:
- User authentication using Amazon Cognito
- Application monitoring using Amazon CloudWatch
- Additional APIs for extended functionality
